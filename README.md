# 🧭 swim> Centralized Issue Tracker

This is the main issue tracker for swim> development — a place to track bugs, ideas, and future improvements across the project. It's primarily for internal use to stay organized, but outside contributions and suggestions are always welcome.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repo helps keep track of what needs to be done across swim> projects — whether it's fixing a bug, testing an idea, or planning a feature. Simple and central.

## 🏷️ Labels
We use emojis to keep things readable and minimal:

| Emoji | Label             | Purpose                            | Title Tag  |
|-------|-------------------|------------------------------------|------------|

| ✨    | `feature`         | New functionality                  | [feature]  |
| 🧹    | `cleanup`         | Code refactor or tidying up        | [cleanup]  |
| 🔧    | `infra`           | DevOps, monitoring, deployment     | [infra]    |
| 📌    | `tracking`        | Meta/multi-part issues             | [tracking] |
| 🧠    | `idea`            | Rough idea or early concept        | [idea]     |

| 🔒    | `security`        | Security related issue             | [security] |

The labels are automatically applied. If the title of your issue is `[bug] [high] AI Traffic spawns to close to player` then `[bug] [high]` will be replaced by `🐞 ❗` and `high-priority`, `bug` labels will be applied.

> Labels are automatically synced using GitHub Actions. Just update `.github/labels.yml` and push.
