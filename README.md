# 🧭 swim> Centralized Issue Tracker

This is the main issue tracker for swim> development — a place to track bugs, ideas, and future improvements across the project. It's primarily for internal use to stay organized, but outside contributions and suggestions are always welcome.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repo helps keep track of what needs to be done across swim> projects — whether it's fixing a bug, testing an idea, or planning a feature. Simple and central.

## 🏷️ Labels
